      "synopsis": "Harry started his third year at Hogwarts on a less than pleasant note. Carelessly, he bewitched Aunt Marge and then fled. On his journey, he read news about the escape of a dangerous prisoner, Sirius Black, rumored to be out to kill him. Mr. Weasley then asked him to make a peculiar promise that no matter what he heard, he wouldn't go looking for Black. Confused, Harry agreed. On the way back to school, Harry encountered Dementors, soul-sucking creatures, patrolling around Hogwarts as protection against Black. The Dementors had a much stronger impact on Harry compared to other Hogwarts students due to his dark childhood. Every time they approached, Harry would collapse. Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, then taught him the Patronus charm, the only spell that could be used to fend off Dementors. The third school year began, and they delved into their tasks. Amidst it all, Ron and Hermione got into a small quarrel over the behavior of their pets. Hermione took an excessive number of classes, leaving her friends puzzled about how she managed them all. In the midst of her busy schedule, Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, repeatedly tried to eat Ron's rat, Scabbers, leading the two friends into continuous arguments about their pets. Their debate came to a halt when they discovered Scabbers' tail sticking out of Crookshanks' mouth, breaking Ron's heart. Harry received a call from Black when he secretly entered the castle. Toward the end of the year, a series of consecutive events unfolded for Harry and his friends. Ron's rat, Scabbers, turned out to be alive and, in fact, a disguised wizard, Peter Pettigrew, who was thought to be dead. Harry then also learned that the one who betrayed his parents was not Sirius Black, but Peter. Unfortunately, Peter managed to escape into the darkness of the night, evading punishment for his crimes."

Situmorang, M.A. This book itself is a biography that chronicles the life of the third president of the Republic of Indonesia, who is also considered the most brilliant individual in Indonesia. He became the first person to successfully create an airplane, bringing pride to the Indonesian nation. This intrigued me to explore the contents of the book, especially since Habibie is a familiar figure, and his story motivates me to aspire to have a high level of curiosity. The book uses language that is easy to understand, making it accessible for me to read word by word. The font size, not too large but also not too small, also facilitates my reading. Within the book, it narrates Habibie's life from his childhood, the emphasis his large family placed on education, his education from elementary school to studying in Germany, Habibie's success in creating an airplane, his presidency, and not forgetting his love story with Ainun, which has inspired many.

      "title": "BJ HABIBIE, THE POWER OF IDEAS",
      "author": "A. Makmur Makka",
      "genre": "Biography",
      "synopsis": "This book contains a collection of ideas, thoughts, and insights from BJ Habibie regarding God, lifestyle, technology, leadership, religion, human resources (HR), Islam, Indonesian identity, industrialization, added value, development strategy, governance system, and Pancasila. It discusses concepts related to the envisioned development of a nation and the conception of humans as God's most noble creation that should not be wasted. In this context, BJ Habibie consistently emphasizes the need for added value for every individual, as the entire process of economy and new discoveries involves value addition. Material added value also occurs in individuals through education, resulting in personal added value. Personal values enable individuals to have a high mentality, thinking ability, analytical skills, policy-making skills, and foster new innovations. BJ Habibie's ideas as a scientist, technocrat, and statesman have inspired society and the nation, demonstrating The Power of Ideas. According to him, technology should not burden society but must improve the quality of life and productivity. Therefore, technology should be adapted to local socio-economic and cultural conditions. In relation to Islam and the Indonesian Muslim Intellectual Association (ICMI), he hopes that ICMI can efficiently and effectively catalyze the continuous added value process for the development of the entire Indonesian nation in the context of practicing Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. The industrialization process in Indonesia extends beyond manufacturing to include agriculture, plantations, forestry, and services. However, aside from manufacturing, most other industries cannot absorb employment as expected. Regarding love, BJ Habibie divides it into five manifestations: first, love for fellow human beings; second, love for the works of humanity; third, love for one's job; fourth, love for nature and one's habitat; and fifth, love for God. In his work, he adheres to rational principles, acts consistently, and applies fairness. Goals, targets, working methods, and operational programs are determined based on objective facts and common sense. Additionally, according to him, life is not about calculations, but life is commitment. Commitment to knowledge, the nation and state, family, work, and colleagues. His five mottos are: work hard, be rational, be honest and open, be humble, and never be a hero.Other ideas are reflected in the nation's development strategy through science and technology, Islam, Indonesian identity, industrialization strategy, and governance system. All of these have shaped and enriched the civilization of the nation. It is known that his ideas are not only theoretical and oratorical notes on paper but have been demonstrated and proven."

      "title": "Aksi Massa",
      "author": "Tan Malaka",
      "genre": "History",
      "synopsis": "What is intriguing about Tan's numerous thoughts articulated in his books is how he captures realities that are challenging for others to grasp, and even more relevant when juxtaposed with the most current realities. Tan is not only an intellectual (in the true definition) who is intelligent but also well-versed in various disciplines of knowledge. We cannot forget Tan's Madilog, in which he discusses the connection between Atoms and Materialism. I honestly can't imagine how brilliant Tan was in his time. How could there be someone so genius among 55 million uneducated people in a situation of colonization that sought to deceive? One of his books that reflects Tan's genius is Aksi Massa (Mass Action). The book is not thick, only 148 pages. It is light in terms of discussion and may be a bit confusing for readers who rarely read old books. Similar to Pram's books that still use outdated language and appear to be in Malay. Aksi Massa is no exception. However, what makes us want to continue reading this book is its provocative and revolutionary writing style. Indeed, the book is a glimpse into the discussion about calls for revolution and mass action during Dutch colonial rule.This book is crucial for activists and students alike. Perhaps, for activists who often engage in mass actions and demonstrations, they will reflect on their actions after reading this book. Perhaps, the mass actions they carry out in the name of the people are not truly for the people, not for the masses. Instead, in Tan's language, it is referred to as Putch. Let's see if our actions, such as the Kamisan rallies, are part of mass action or more aligned with Putch behavior.According to Tan, Putch is an action by a small clandestine group that moves quietly and is not related to the people or the masses. These Putch groups usually only design according to their own desires and capabilities without considering the feelings and capabilities of the masses.When these Putch groups take action, the masses will not come to their aid. Not because the masses are ignorant and not paying attention to the ongoing situation, but because the masses will only fight for their immediate needs according to their interests, be it economic, political, social, and so on."

      "title": "Mencapai Indonesia Merdeka",
      "author": "Ir. Soekarno",
      "genre": "History",
      "synopsis": "This book is designed to remind us of the struggle of the Indonesian people in gaining independence. Gaining independence was not an easy matter; the Indonesian people had to endure various significant and anarchic trials. Starting from the cruelty inflicted by the Dutch, famously known as cultuurstelsel (forced cultivation), the Japanese with romusha (forced labor), and the Portuguese with the spice trade monopoly.The book also serves as a reminder for the Indonesian people, who, until now, have not achieved genuine independence. To achieve true independence, the concept of politics often emphasized by Sukarno, namely self-help and non-cooperation/standing on one's own feet (self-reliance), is crucial. Here, the reviewer needs to elaborate on how the concept of self-help and non-cooperation in politics was formed.It all started with the rejection of the thesis Profesor Veth: Indonesia has never been independent, from the Hindu era to the Dutch era. Instead, the Hindu kingdom became the ruler of the Indonesian state and was colonized by the Dutch.At that time, Indonesia was independent, but it was the inhabitants who became the sharpeners of the colonizer's knife, exploiting the common people to pave the way for Early European Capitalism in Asia.To facilitate Early Capitalism, the colonizers manipulated the mindset of the Indonesian people, gradually changing ancient feudalism to a new feudalism. In other words, they destabilized the kingdom from within.After destabilizing the kingdom, the colonizers implemented their activities through violence and cruelty, such as forced cultivation and then escalating to heavier policies like taxing agricultural products such as cloves, nutmeg, and the monopoly right to buy burdensome agricultural products.However, when modern capitalism produced surplus capital, its system was transformed into free competition, automatically opening the gates for investors to invest in Indonesia, a practice that continues to this day, as seen with Freeport.The people of Indonesia were extremely impoverished at that time, with incomes as low as 8 cents. However, it is not impossible that this homeland is rich in resources for the impoverished common people and will never experience prosperity under the colonizer. Therefore, despite being colonized, the people of Indonesia would never be miserable because Indonesia is a land rich in abundance.After gradually indoctrinating the thoughts and energy of the Indonesian people, the sound minds and energies of the Marhaen people began to rediscover themselves. Through the Fajar Menyingsing movement, the Indonesian people rose again.The Fajar Menyingsing movement aimed to achieve significant change. Not through Bojuis, Ningrat, Radicalism, or even Marhaen Reformists. But through the path of radical Marhaen party that knows when to strike its blows (timing).This party would later have a vision and mission: if Indonesia wants to be truly independent, it must break free from the grip of imperialism and capitalism by cutting off its systems, abolishing the systems, and being free from the systems of imperialism and capitalism, thus achieving the golden bridge of independence.With the imperialist and feudal positions serving as references for imperialists to maintain their position, there is only one word: opposition/contradiction with one's own strength, one's own thinking, and one's own power. In political terms, it is to believe in one's own strength (self-help and non-cooperation) and, in Soekarno's words, to be self-reliant (standing on one's own feet).In implementing the politics of self-help and non-cooperation, radicalism is used to subdue imperialism.After subduing imperialism, a new problem arises on the other side: who will lead Indonesia in the future. The leader must be an Egalitarian from the Marhaen class to prevent Nationalism-Feudalism and Nationalism-Bourgeoisie. This would only lead the Marhaen people into the political abyss. Meanwhile, Marhaen proposes a democracy based on mutual cooperation in the form of socio-democracy and socio-Nationalism. This would eliminate capitalism and bourgeoisie.With all this, Marhaen's aspirations for Indonesia to be independent will be realized.This background explains why the concept of self-help and non-cooperation in politics was formed and made it a powerful weapon for the Indonesian people in gaining independence. It becomes the special slogan or foundation that will never be possessed by any other nation.Here, the reviewer will also provide knowledge about self-help politics in other countries, including India and Ireland, intended to enrich the reader's insights.In India, the concept of self-help is embodied in Swadeshi, spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi. Swadeshi here means boycotting British goods and is a strategy for the struggle for Indian independence, attacking British imperialism. At that time, India was a colony of Britain led by Albion (Prime Minister of Britain) with the concept of its imperialism being Mechanism and Industrialism.In Ireland, the concept of self-help is the Sinn Fein politics pioneered by Arthur Griffith. Sinn Fein here means forgetting the English nation, working as if there is no English nation in the world, and believing in oneself (Ireland). This is meant to separate from England and demand independence from England. Because England and Ireland are actually one region, but since the Irish members in the British Parliament are few, their people arealways oppressed by England."
